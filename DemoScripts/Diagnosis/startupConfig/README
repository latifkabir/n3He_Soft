Steps:

1.Change the IP in diagnose.sh to fit your DAQ. Also change any sleep time you will be confortable with.
  Your DAQ needs to be configured to give you Password free ssh.

2.With the DAQ running,from same directory(as *.sh files) from the terminal do: ./GetConfig.sh > ExpectedConfig
Now open ExpectedConfig file and take a look to make sure it's the config that you expect. If not the test ends here other wise continue reading.

3.Now just do: ./diagnose.sh

4.The program will break when misconfiguration found.
