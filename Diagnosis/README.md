Baymax Diagnostic Program
============================
It is a Baymax like program as DAQ's healthcare companion using bash scripting. The program can detect and fix itself any issue automatically that the n3He DAQ might encounter. This program enables any naive person taking shift for the n3He experiment.


Note:
-------
1. Make sure all files are in place.
2. Before you execute diagnosis make sure all .sh files or binaries are given execution permission.
3. Inside a bash function use complete path for bash program to be called. This is true specially if the diagnosis will be started on gnome-terminal from another program(watchdog) using an desktop icon.
