The basestar is now up for n3He analysis. The data is being transferred to the directory ' /mnt/idata01/data/ ' and the analysis library is compiled in a shared directory ' /home/npdg/n3He/libn3He/lib '.

So a quick start can be as follows from any user account:

1.  Add the following lines to the .bashrc file & save it :

if [ -f /home/npdg/n3He/libn3He/bin/thisn3He.sh ]; then
        . /home/npdg/n3He/libn3He/bin/thisn3He.sh
fi

2. Start a new terminal , go to  /home/npdg/n3He/libn3He/analysis/ directory & try running sample analysis scripts from ROOT.

3. The Data browser GUI (named as n3HeData) can be opened issuing the command '/home/npdg/n3He/n3HeData/n3HeData' from the terminal. Copy the binary to your home directory if you will be using the GUI frequently.


Other user specific customization can be achieved following the instruction in the ReadMe file in the respective directory. The latest developments and releases can be found from n3He wiki > Software.
