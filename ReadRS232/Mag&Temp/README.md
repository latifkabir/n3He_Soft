Field & Temperature Monitoring Program
========================================

The program combines Linux driver for the magnetometer from Bartington, Model:Mag-03 DAM to read magnetic field and Linux driver for OMEGA CN606 & CN612 Series Temperature sensor. Both uses serial communications. Their readings are shown on a curses window to display both magnetic filed and temperature which gets updated.
