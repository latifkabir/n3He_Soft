24/7 Watchdog Program
=======================

The n3He experiment has several critical parameters that need to be checked periodically apart from uninterrupted data taking process.The 24/7 watchdog program as a cron job checks for all critical parameters along with DAQ's smooth operation. In the event of any abnormal activity it can send text alert to the user. It can also call in Baymax to diagnose and fix issues and restore the data taking process on itself.
