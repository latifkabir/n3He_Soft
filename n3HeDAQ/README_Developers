 n3He DAQ Control Program
===============================


Instruction for the Developers
=================================

n3He DAQ Control Program  Version: 1.0
---------------------------------------
0. The src directory includes three separate sub-directories "core, gui, lib" where the corresponding source codes will be placed gradually.
The makefile is configured to put the corresponding object files in newly created corresponding directory (named core,gui,lib) inside "bin" while compiling. The "core" directory contains all core sources for running from the terminal(command line) mode.

1. From n3HeDAQ directory just do: make
Note: The source code uses some c++11 features requiring your compiler to be c++11 supported.

2. To remove the object files but keeping the binary do: make clean



3. The binary file (named 'n3He') will be produced inside */n3He/n3HeDAQ/bin


4. Testing the program:
-------------------------------
The DAQ to control computer data transfer situation can be mocked up on you own lapton easily in the following way:
i. Choose a big enough (say 500 MB) file on your computer to be transferred via localhost.
ii. From the terminal do: "nc -l 1234 < to_be_sent_filename"
   This will be streaming that file to the port 1234 via localhost (IP: 127.0.0.1) to be read by client Socket.
iii. Change the n3HeDAQ source for appropriate IP and Port (here 127.0.0.1 and 1234) and do 'make'
iv. running 'n3He' will make an exact copy of the file sent.
v. This procedure can be replicated to mock up more thn one DAQ running simultaneously. 

vi. If you enable cout.write() (L67 in Socket.cpp) , then if you do :" n3He | pv > filename", then it will also show the data transfer rate.
