From the terminal do the following:
 
n3he start :
  This will start the data taking process for all the DAQ modules for the default run length continuously.

n3he start LENGTH RUN: 
   Where, LENGTH = The length of each run in Megabyte, RUN = the number of runs to be taken. 
   Note RUN and LENGTH must be integer.
   This will take only 'RUN' number of runs of length 'LENGTH' Megabyte each for all the DAQ modules.


n3he daq MODULE:
    Where, MODULE= The DAQ module you want to run. It acn be either 21,23,24,30.
    This will take data only for the DAQ module number 'MODULE' in continuous mode for the default run length.
    If the module number is not specified it will take data only for module 21 by default.       

n3he daq MODULE LENGTH RUN:
    Where, MODULE= The DAQ module you want to run. It acn be either 21,23,24,30.
           LENGTH = The length of each run in Megabyte, RUN= the number of runs to be taken. 
    This will take data only for the DAQ module number 'MODULE' for 'RUN' number of runs of length 'LENGTH' each.
    If MODULE, RUN and LENGTH are not specified the default values are, MODULE=21, RUN=continuous runs and LENGTH = default run      
    length.       

n3he config :
    This will display the current configuration (Sample rate,Averaging, Hi Resolution mode etc.) for all the DAQ module.
    This option is yet to be implemented.

n3he help : 
   This will bring this help session. 

To quit the program while in continuous data taking mode :
-- At first let the current run finish.
-- When the run finishes and it sleeps a while, press Ctrl+C to quit the program. 



A Typical run with command "n3he start" will look as follows:

Run 88 in progress ... ... 

[==================================================] 100%     

data_file-21 has been renamed to run88data_file-21
data_file-22 has been renamed to run88data_file-22
data_file-23 has been renamed to run88data_file-23
data_file-30 has been renamed to run88data_file-30

Phew!!! Done with run number : 88

----->DAQ is now sleeping for 5 seconds, Press Crtl+C if no further run is expected<------
