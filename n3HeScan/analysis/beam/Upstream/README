In the BeamDataUp.txt or BeamDataDown.txt files:
The first column is Y coord and second column is X coord. These coordinates are in step size (for Velmex motor , 4000 Step equals 1 Inch), the negative sign indicated which way the motor is spinning.
Third column is Average Intensity of M4 monitor used for the scan and fourth column is Average Intensity of M1 monitor(used for normalization). These intensities are in volt.

The Up Stream scan is a 17x19 scan.
The Down Stream scan is a 17x22 scan.

Reference point:
The coordinate X:10.0413cm  Y:12.0481cm found to be the beam centroid analyzing the upstream data, thus corresponds to the beam center as marked in the sketch(15.5 cm,15.1 cm) showing ruler.
