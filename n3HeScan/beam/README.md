Robot Controller Program for Beamm Scan
========================================

The n3He has an XYZ robot that can move along the three axes. It uses Velmex motor with stages. It communicates with the Linux system via serial communication. This program is to control it. This robot controller program was used for neutron beam scan in restricted highly radioactive area for the n3He experiment at Oak Ridge National Lab.
